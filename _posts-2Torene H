The excel spread sheet that I have done was the Employee Overtime and Supplemental Earnings in Chicago. 
For some of the finding, many of the city employees made over $50,000In overtime from January 2015- December 2015.
Out of the 24,000+ city employees listed, Deputy District Chief of the Fire Department, James Soludczyk, 
has earned nearly $100,000 in overtime. However, there are other about 7 employees.
