The data set that I used was the SAT scores of high school students in New York City. While using the linear regression, I noticed that it would be quite confusing to understand. The average scores of students who has taken the SATs were averaging around the same numbers. Therefore, the the results in the table were all in the same section. This table would have worked better it was a bar or line graph. Also, It  should show the schools who had the highest and lowest average. When I had set the r^2 the result was 0.7.
