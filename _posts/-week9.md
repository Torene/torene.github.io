I am very interested in education and learing about the pay that teachers make each year. With the data that I had used from data protal, I have noticed that teachers make more money than I thought. Some people I know who teach, say they do not make over $30-45,000 during the first year. One think they could have added was the salary of other teachers in different states, for people to compare and contrast. If D.C. teachers are making more money than other cities, it should be marketed for other teachers to come to this city, too. 

I have noticed that teachers also have great benefits that other jobs may not offer. Some of these benefits consist of: 

Health Insurance

HMO,PPO, POS 
Dental and Optical Insurance 

Basic Life Insurance
Supplemental Life Insurance
Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance
Short-Term Disability Insurance
Long-Term Disability Insurance

Other Benefits
Teacherâ€™s Retirement Plan
Flexible Spending Accounts (for dependent care & health care)
403(b) Tax Sheltered Annuities
DC Teachers Federal Credit Union
457 Deferred Compensation Plan
Loan Cancellation or Deferment
AT&T Discount Program for District of Columbia Employees
Employer Assisted Housing Program (Up to $11,500 for first-time homebuyers in DC)
HUD Good Neighbor Next Door Program (50% off the list price for HUD homes)
Discounted memberships to Washington Sports Clubs

Even though the chart explained that the teachers make a certain amount of money after a full year, I would like to know exactly which schools are paying teachers the most based off of their experience.
